    <h2>ABOUT:</h2>
    <p>This piece portrays the emotions and thoughts that go across a performers mind while performing in front of a large crowded audience. The dancer stays behind a screen and all you can see is her shadow.</p>
      <aside>
      <p>This piece was collaborated with Lucy Strauss, Hanna Van Inwegen and Kathleen Zaragosa as a part of the Bang Festival at UBC.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 1.2vw;">In creating this piece, we used many media components such as phone lights, MAX MSP, DMX lights, Facetime and live performance for sound and dance. Hana used a wireless microphone to amplify her breathing and create a tense atmosphere. Lucy's Viola controlled the brightness of the DMX lights while my cello controlled the movement/direction and focus of the DMX lights. I also controlled the recorded audience Foley sounds with the FCB 1010 MIDI Foot Controller. These sounds were programmed to pan from the back of the hall to the front. In the middle of the piece, we incorporate live video projected to the screen.
      <br><br>This piece used a 8-channel sound system. It actively panned across the multiple speakers in the hall. This was a project for my minor in Applied Music Technology at The University of British Columbia.</p>
