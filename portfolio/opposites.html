    <h2>ABOUT:</h2>
    <p>
      This piece plays with juxtaposition. Freedom vs constriction; light vs dark; floating vs draining; building vs destroying; becoming vs unbecoming; curvature vs angles (circles vs triangles); control vs chaos
      <aside>
      <p>This piece was collaborated with Alex Hawthorn and dancers: Ashley Sartell, Tetiana Sklyarova as a part of the 2-week intensive class at California Institute of the Arts. Our group were one of three groups that performed in PLAYLAB 2020.</p>

    <hr>
      <p style="font-size: 1.2vw;">Our dancers used ZIGSIM to track their movements, and through MAX MSP and Logmein Hamachi, I was able to take OSC data from across the USA to Vancouver, Canada. I took this data and set each dancer to a set of MIDI instruments and allowed them to control a particle system I created with TouchDesigner.
        Aside from the MIDI instruments being triggered by the dancers, I also contributed live Cello improvisation throughout the performance. In the background, we had looped audio clips of our themes automated to chage every 5 minutes to allow some framework for the improvising dancers. Finally, everything was sent to Alex to collage together in Isadora.
