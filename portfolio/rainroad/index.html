  <h2 class="center redtitle">about</h2>
  <div class="color-box">
      <p class="center d" style="text-align: left;">
        Rain road is based on the storybook, Rain Road, written by Michaella Moon and illustrated by Joanne Kim.
        <br>The story follows the character Jane. Jane worries about her crops in the drought but manages to find a way to convince their friend Cloud to help them water their crops.
        As they skip along the dry desert; Cloud, overflowing with rain, trails behind Jane mesmerized by their singing.

        <br>This installation invites the audience to interact with the five umbrellas hanging upside down from the ceiling.
        Due to orientation of the umbrellas, the whole installation is flipped upside down. The sky, being projected closer
        to the space’s floor and the desert scenery towards the ceiling. Each of these umbrellas has its own photocell sensors,
        a light-responsive sensor, and arduinos built onto the clear plastic umbrellas. When a light source is shined into
        the tops of the umbrellas, it triggers several elements in the installation to change. This one action sets into motion
        both an aural and visual change. Each umbrella has its own characteristic audio effect that is added to the song
        from a playlist of rain-themed songs.

        <span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 1vw;">
        <br><br><br>The playlist currently includes 11 songs:
              <br>BJ Thomas- Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head
              <br>Blind Mellon- No Rain
              <br>Creedence Clearwater Revival- Have You Ever Seen The Rain
              <br> Gene Kelly- Singing In The Rain
              <br>Guns N’ Roses- November Rain
              <br>Lady Gaga- Rain On Me
              <br>Led Zeppelin- The Rain Song
              <br>Mariah Carey- Through the Rain
              <br>Prince- Purple Rain
              <br>The Beatles- Rain
              <br>Tim McGraw- She’s My Kind Of Rain
        </span>
      <br><br>With the same light shining motion, there is a change in the projection mapped, AI-generated scenery.
      These images were created using a VQGAN+CLIP AI image models. Through this model, one is able to generate images using
      carefully selected texts and sentences. Different sentences and words generated different images. This installation uses four
      images generated by a VQGAN+CLIP model. There are two sets of these images that represents the before and after of dry desert.
      Even though similar keywords were used to create the images, one set of images included more greenery and a sense of abundance
      than the other two. The audience interaction switches between the two pairs.

      <br><br>This installation uses multiple programs. Arduino, to control the sensors and LED strips. Processing, to control and
      facilitate the data (as a hub that connects the sensors to all the other programs via OSC). MaxMsp, to control the playlist of
       songs and audio effects. TouchDesigner, for all the visuals and projection mapping.

      <p class="lycD"> Guest performer Anais Azul performed their piece "I Came From" in the Road Road installation space.<br>
           As Anais improvised and sang with their loop pedal, the audience members interacted and co-composed alongside them.<br>
           By triggering each umbrella, participants were able to add pre-recorded layers to their performance. </span> </p>

      <p class="lyc" style="margin-top:5vw; margin-bottom: -2vw;">RAIN ROAD: Anais Azul _______________________December 16th 2021</p>
      <p class="lycD" style="margin-bottom: 5vw;"> The Rain Road installation welcomed guest performers Anais Azul, Chuck Behring and Yolanda Shao. <br>
        As Anais and Chuck improvised with their and each other's loop pedal, the audience members interacted and <br>
        co-composed alongside them. By triggering each umbrella, participants were able to add pre-recorded layers <br>
        to their performance. Yolanda was able to fill the space by creating movements according to the audience's interaction <br>
        with the umbrellas. </span> </p>
