  <h1 class="title">I remember playing loads of games as a kid. Even though I was an only child, I always played--dance class was a huge social key of course, too. When I was alone, Barbie and Polly Pocket were my jam. I’d create worlds with those dolls. I’d also make up dances and make songs, all incredibly articulate and polished of course. With my neighbors, we’d play hours of night games and get all riled up. Sardines and kick the can were my favorite. We’d also adventure in the creek and pretend we were creating soup for the “woodland animals”--AKA the deer.

When I was alone, Barbie and Polly pocket were my jam. I have pretty vivid memories of myself looking down at my dolls, hair askew and clothes in shambles. I remember drifting off into an alternate mind space as I would play, where I was aware that I had these dolls in my hands but the narrative were leagues beyond my physical reality. My imagination filled in gaps, gaps I created with my own perception. It felt a truly social thing, even though I was “alone”. I never felt alone, so wrapped up in my doll scenarios.

[Playing] felt a very social thing, even though I was “alone”. I relate to this a lot as an adult now, as I bask in the alone time I desperately carve out for myself. It’s a funny thing, isn’t it? We can feel alone among many, and we can feel surrounded when we’re all by ourselves. I think that play for me as a young girl was crucial. It opened my imagination and I didn’t even notice it until now, at age 22. There’s power in the ability to manifest play and enjoyment on your own. That can spread and affect others, too.
